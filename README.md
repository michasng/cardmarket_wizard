# Cardmarket wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Improved cardmarket shopping wizard.
Finds the best combination of sellers for cards on your wants lists. ü™Ñ

Currently only supports Yu-Gi-Oh!.

## How does it work?

This application guides you through the process step-by-step, but here is the general idea:

- The application will start a controlled Chromium browser.
- Use the browser to login and navigate to your wants list.  
  I assure you that your credentials are not read, but feel free to check the code.
- Now leave the browser alone and confirm your wants list in the application.
- The browser will automatically visit each article on your wants list to find the best offers for each.
- The browser will then visit some promising sellers to optimize shipping costs.
- You will then be shown the best combination of sellers to purchase your wants from.
